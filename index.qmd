# About Me

Hello there, and welcome to my site! I am a PhD student working towards a PhD in Epidemiology & Biostatistics with an emphasis in Data Analysis and Modeling. I attained my MS, also in Epidemiology & Biostatistics (emphasis in Epidemiology), as well as a Certificate in Infectious Disease Epidemiology in May 2022. I have particular interest and research emphasis in infectious diseases. I am passionate about “real world” implications of public health research and practice on individuals and context‐aware data analytic approaches to answering epidemiological questions.

When not working or in school, I love textile crafts (knitting, crocheting, cross-stitch/embroidery, sewing, etc.), traveling, hiking, and spending time with my family, dog, and cat!

Please peruse this site and feel free to contact me through the email icon! I am actively working on building this site, so please excuse any errors, messiness, or blank pages!
